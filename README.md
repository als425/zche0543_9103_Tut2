# The Scream - Interactive Emotional Recreation


## How to Interact with the Artwork
1. Open the sketch in your browser (index.html).
2. Wait for it to load — the background image, collage, and texture will appear automatically.
3. **Click anywhere** on the screen:  
   - Each click **raises the anxiety level**.  
   - The main collage image **shakes** more intensely.  
   - A **red translucent overlay** strengthens across the screen.  
4. **Watch the top-left anxiety bar:**  It fills with red as anxiety builds.  
5. **Wait a few seconds**, shaking and redness will fade naturally.  

## 🧠 Individual Animation Approach
My personal version is driven by **User Input**, not time or audio.  
Every user action directly alters the emotional state of the scene.
