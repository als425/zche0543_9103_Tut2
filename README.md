# The Scream - Interactive Emotional Recreation


## How to Interact with the Artwork
1. Open the sketch in your browser (index.html).
2. Wait for it to load — the background image, collage, and texture will appear automatically.
3. **Click anywhere** on the screen:  
   - Each click **raises the anxiety level**.  
   - The main collage image **shakes** more intensely.  
   - A **red translucent overlay** strengthens across the screen.  
4. **Watch the top-left anxiety bar:**  It fills with red as anxiety builds.  
5. **Wait a few seconds**, shaking and redness will fade naturally.  

## Individual Animation Approach
My personal version is driven by **User Input**, not time or audio.  Every user action directly alters the emotional state of the scene.
| Type | Effect |
|-------------|--------|
| Mouse Click | Increases anxiety, triggers shaking & red overlay |
| Time Decay | Gradually reduces anxiety for calm recovery |
| Collage Work | Replace and mask some section of the group coding |

## Inspiration & References
This project was inspired by the psychological experience of **anxiety and emotional fragmentation**.  
When someone experiences anxiety, it often feels as though the self begins to **deconstruct**.  
Once coherent identity becomes scattered into unrelated pieces, much like a **collage** of disconnected fragments.  
To visualise this sensation, I drew inspiration from **collage art**, where separate images are reassembled into a new emotional whole.  
The collage technique allows for tension between unity and chaos. It's mirroring how anxiety pulls the self apart while still attempting to maintain form.  
This artistic metaphor helped shape the visual layering, shaking, and overlapping textures in my code-based recreation of *The Scream*.  
As scholar Graham (2008) notes, *“collage operates through rupture and recombination, revealing the instability of meaning and identity”*, that aligns closely with the emotional volatility I aimed to represent through motion and interaction.
